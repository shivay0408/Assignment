    "#Question No.- 02\n",
    "#Ans.- \n",
    "#The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. \n",
    "#It helps in data hiding and abstraction by restricting direct access to certain components and exposing only what is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2.Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (derived class or subclass) is created from an existing class (base class or superclass). \n",
    "#The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass and can also have its own additional attributes and methods. \n",
    "#It promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of a hierarchical class structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability to take on multiple forms. \n",
    "#In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. \n",
    "#It enables the same method name to behave differently based on the object it is called upon. \n",
    "#Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (in inheritance) and method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "#4.Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. \n",
    "#It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. \n",
    "#Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for other classes to follow without specifying the implementation details."
